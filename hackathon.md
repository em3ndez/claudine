# Claudine: meta-cognitive and self-modifying AI agent

https://github.com/xemantic/claudine

An AI agent, which can think about own thinking, and modify/extend its own code.

## Description

Problem: we have thinking/reasoning LLMs, but do we have thinking AI agents?

We need agents which can:

- self-reflect
- modify own code
- write own prompts
- extend itself with new tools
